This was my project for DAT 301, Exploring Data in R and Python, course at Arizona State University. 

Using airline passenger satisfaction survey data found on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?select=train.csv)

I was curious to know which are the biggest factors to customer satisfaction. What are some improvements that the airline can make?
